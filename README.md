Stash Warning sends warnings about players revealing stashes that are not placed by themselves. Warnings are sent to admins in-game, Discord (optionally), and logged to files. This plugin is intended to help identify and raise suspicion towards cheaters.

## Configuration

Settings:
* Webhook URL (leave empty to disable discord feature)
* Ignore players in the same team -> true

**Delete old config file (oxide/config/StashWarning.json) when updating to 1.2.0**
